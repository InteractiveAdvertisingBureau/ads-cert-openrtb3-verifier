# Verification Service for Signed Bid Requests

Ad Fraud has always been a big problem in the ad industry. Inventory spoofing is a problem that still exists where a request can be modified by anyy entity in the supply chain to pose it as premium inventory. This is the problem which ads.cert tries to solve.

How ads.cert works?

The publisher or the signing authority maintains the private key 
A small set of essential fields and values in the request are used for the Digest
The signing service generates the Digital Signature using the digest and the private key
The request is sent to the Exchanges/DSPâ€™s including the Digital Signature, DsMap and other fields
The Signature Checking Service verifies the signature about fields used to create the digital signature. Usually for offline purposes.

## Offering from media.net:

To allow for fast-track boarding for ads.cert, media.net is offering the verification service as an open-source solution. The below features are supported. This service can be used for verification of the digital signature in ORTB requests by checking whether the values of the fields using which the signature was created were forged or not.


## Features:

Digital Signature Verification - through OpenRTB 3.0 object or Digest 
Support for Sampling 
Support for Offline Verification 
Hooks for reporting which can be used for internal reporting purposes
Minimizing latencies for public key lookup through in-memory caching

## Usage

Instantiate an object of ``` VerificationService ``` to access the methods for verifying the request. The class VerificationService is thread-safe, and can be used as a singleton. 

## Features

### Sampling

Aditionally, a sampling percentage can be provided while instantiation to control the percentage of requests for which verification is desired. The default value of sampling percentage is 100, which means that all requests will be verified.

```java
int samplingPercentage = 50; // Sampling Percentage is 50.
VerificationService service = new VerificationServiceJCache(samplingPercentage);
```

### Message Expiry

Support has also been provided to optionally check message expiry. The timestamp in OpenRTB is assumed to be the time elapsed since UTC epoch. If the difference between timestamp in the OpenRTB request and current system timestamp exceeds a pre-defined margin, the service will fail the verification.

```java
int samplingPercentage = 50; // Sampling Percentage is 50.
long messageExpiryTimeInMillis = 2000l; // Message should be received under 2 seconds.
new VerificationService(samplingPercentage, messageExpiryTimeInMillis).verifyRequest(OpenRTB openRTB, Boolean debug, PublicKey publicKey, boolean checkMessageExpiry
```

### Metrics and Reporting

A reporting hook through ``` MetricsManager ``` has been provided for collecting and pushing metrics to a suitable data sink. One can pass an implementation of ``` MetricsManager ``` to the constructor of ``` VerificationService ``` as below:

```java
MetricsManager metricsManager = new MetricsManager();
VerificationService service = new VerificationServiceJCache(metricsManager);

// with custom sampling and message expiry time
int samplingPercentage = 50; // Sampling Percentage is 50.
long messageExpiryTimeInMillis = 2000l; // Message should be received under 2 seconds.
VerificationService serviceWithCustomSamplingAndExpiry = new VerificationService(samplingPercentage, messageExpiryTimeInMillis, metricsManager);
```

### Cache

We have also provided the functionality to fetch and cache the Public Keys for different domains. So that, one can save time during verification. Cache will expire after a preconfigured time (default 30 days). Two different cache implementations, using JCache and Guava, are provided for VerificationService. The corresponding classes are ``` VerificationServiceJCache ``` and ``` VerificationServiceGuavaCache ```. 

Additionally, default implementations for both caches are also provided. You can either use them or pass your own cache object to the constructor.

***JCache:***

```java
Cache<String, PublicKey> cache = DefaultJCacheBuilder.newBuilder()
                                       .setExpiryForAccess(...)
                                       .setExpiryForCreation(...)
                                       .setExpiryForUpdate(...)
                                       .setCacheLoader(...)
                                       .build();
// without sampling and message expiry                                       
VerificationServiceJCache service = new VerificationServiceJCache(cache);

// with custom sampling
int samplingPercentage = 50; // Sampling Percentage is 50.
VerificationServiceJCache serviceWithCustomSampling = new VerificationServiceJCache(cache, samplingPercentage);

// with custom message expiry 
long messageExpiryTimeInMillis = 2000l; // Message should be received under 2 seconds.
VerificationServiceJCache serviceWithCustomSamplingAndExpiry = new VerificationServiceJCache(cache, samplingPercentage, messageExpiryTimeInMillis);

// with Metrics Manager
MetricsManager metricsManager = new MetricsManager();
VerificationServiceJCache serviceWithMetricSupport = new VerificationServiceJCache(cache, samplingPercentage, messageExpiryTimeInMillis, metricsManager);
```

***Guava:***

```java
Cache<String, PublicKey> cache = DefaultGuavaCacheBuilder.newBuilder()
                                        .setMaximumSize(...)
                                        .setExpireAfterAccess(...)
                                        .setExpireAfterWrite(...)
                                        .build();

VerificationServiceGuavaCache service = new VerificationServiceGuavaCache(cache);

// with custom sampling
int samplingPercentage = 50; // Sampling Percentage is 50.
VerificationServiceGuavaCache serviceWithCustomSampling = new VerificationServiceJCache(cache, samplingPercentage);

// with custom message expiry 
long messageExpiryTimeInMillis = 2000l; // Message should be received under 2 seconds.
VerificationServiceGuavaCache serviceWithCustomSamplingAndExpiry = new VerificationServiceJCache(cache, samplingPercentage, messageExpiryTimeInMillis);

// with Metrics Manager
MetricsManager metricsManager = new MetricsManager();
VerificationServiceGuavaCache serviceWithMetricSupport = new VerificationServiceGuavaCache(cache, samplingPercentage, messageExpiryTimeInMillis, metricsManager);
```

Both the default cache builders have default values set for fields. For example, one can write ``` DefaultGuavaCacheBuilder.newBuilder().build() ``` 
and it will return a cache created with parameters set to default values.


### Offline Bulk verification

Bulk verification can be performed by passing the path to the input file containing JSONs of OpenRTB requests (each line has complete json of one request), along with the path to the file to which output should be written.

```java
FileVerificationService.verify("input.txt", "output.txt");
```

## Requirements
Java 8
